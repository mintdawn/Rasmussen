# Rasmussen
A repository created for the Rasmussen class Fundamentals of Mobile Web Application Development.

This is an imaginary site done for class. Eventually it will connect to a database.

Responsiveness added to the navbar and logo moved to the navbar. Jumbotron added at the top with just the company name in it. The make the jumbotron and the navbar go to the edge of the main wrapper div I had to put them in a row class div and add 100% width styling to the css file. I learned a ton about bootstrap and learned that there is a whole responsive system for padding and margins that can be used with a lot of the elements. The entire site should be working okay on a mobile device now.

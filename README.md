# Rasmussen
A repository created for the Rasmussen class Fundamentals of Mobile Web Application Development.

This is an imaginary site done for class. Eventually it will connect to a database.

Responsiveness added to the navbar and logo moved to the navbar. Jumbotron added at the top with just the company name in it. The make the jumbotron and the navbar go to the edge of the main wrapper div I had to put them in a row class div and add 100% width styling to the css file. I learned a ton about bootstrap and learned that there is a whole responsive system for padding and margins that can be used with a lot of the elements. The entire site should be working okay on a mobile device now.

This week I got the database connected to Azure and formatted the noodles.php page to display the data received from Azure. The file noodles.html had to be changed to noodles.php to work correctly. I found that bootstrap classes worked within php and that made things a lot easier. I was able to display the data with very little problem. I also added a little javascript one page2.html to create a page that generates random facts about Asian noodles. I removed several .php files from the repository that I no longer need for this project. There is a file called main.html in the repository. That file is the index page for the root of my Azure school project. It is unrelated to the Noodle Company site. Next week we will be working with sitemaps.

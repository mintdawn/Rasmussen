# Rasmussen
A repository created for the Rasmussen class Fundamentals of Mobile Web Application Development.

This is an imaginary site done for class. Eventually it will connect to a database.

Responsiveness added to the navbar and logo moved to the navbar. Jumbotron added at the top with just the company name in it. The make the jumbotron and the navbar go to the edge of the main wrapper div I had to put them in a row class div and add 100% width styling to the css file. I learned a ton about bootstrap and learned that there is a whole responsive system for padding and margins that can be used with a lot of the elements. The entire site should be working okay on a mobile device now.

This week I got the database connected to Azure and formatted the noodles.php page to display the data received from Azure. The file noodles.html had to be changed to noodles.php to work correctly. I found that bootstrap classes worked within php and that made things a lot easier. I was able to display the data with very little problem. I also added a little javascript one page2.html to create a page that generates random facts about Asian noodles. I removed several .php files from the repository that I no longer need for this project. There is a file called main.html in the repository. That file is the index page for the root of my Azure school project. It is unrelated to the Noodle Company site. Next week we will be working with sitemaps.

This week I changed a lot about the appearance of the site. The assignment this week was about sitemaps and navigation. I already had a navbar at the top so I worked on making it fancier. I learned how to add icons to the navigation buttons using font awesome's cdn. So now each button has a little descriptive icon next to the link. Our discussion post involved best practices for creating a UI that provides a good user experience. That is another reason I added the little images on the buttons. I also redid the color scheme a little. I tried to limit the palette to 5 colors wherever possible and all buttons outside of the navbar are black and the navbar hover color is black. I generated a color palette by taking a screen shot with the 3 bowls of noodles on the front page and extracting colors from it using Adobe Color/Kuler. I also moved the cat logo up to the header so there was nothing on the navbar except the links. The logo is set as a background that will disappear when the device viewing the site is below a certain size. That background cat is a clickable link back to the home page but, I'm not sure why. I thought I would be sacrificing that feature when using the image as a background but, somehow it still has a hyperlink. Going back again to good user experience. Some sites suggested it was good to add a little bit of animation to the site. The tone of the images used on the site sets the tone for the site. I want this site to be a little bit silly. I want it to be a happy site. I added an animated .gif to the Noodle Facts page. The database now loads two columns of noodle cards when viewed from a desktop and one column when viewed from a small device.

This week I created folders for each course module. Each module folder contains two folders. One folder is for activity assignments and one is for course project assignments. I had to figure out how to download older versions of the website by using the GitHub repository's history feature. I was able to download the website as it was the week I uploaded it. In this way you are able to view the evolution of the site.
